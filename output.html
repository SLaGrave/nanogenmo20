<p>A field guide to help you identify the "local" flora and fauna. Written for NaNoGenMo 2020.</p>
<p>I knew well enough the whole world, and every thing they say or do. To this i answer, neither gerrard nor parkinson, or any that ever wrote in the english tongue, much more than i have done? They say reason makes a man differ from a beast; if that be true, why do they contradict one another? For forty years he has undergone in seeing them. Perhaps their authors knew a reason for every thing in it, was formed of a great god. But you will say, what need i have made very many additions to every sheet in the like nature, ever gave one wise reason for their judgment, quote old authors? In mr. louis agassiz fuertes, the national geographic magazine—that of november, 1916, devoted to the various motions of the book itself. Truly in writing this work first, to satisfy myself, i drew out all the authors i could read gave me but little satisfaction in this country. Honesty, a stranger in our “book of birds.” </p>
