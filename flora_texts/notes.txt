CONSIDERING divers shires in this nation give divers names to one and the same herb, and that the common name which it bears in one county, is not known in another; I shall take the pains to set down all the names that I know of each herb: pardon me for setting that name first, which is most common to myself. Besides Amara Dulcis, some call it Mortal, others Bitter-sweet; some Woody Night-shade, and others Felon-wort.IT is called All-heal, Hercules’s All-heal, and Hercules’s Woundwort, because it is supposed that Hercules learned the herb and its virtues from Chiron, when he learned physic of him. Some call it Panay, and others Opopane-wort.BESIDES the common name, it is called Orchanet, and Spanish Bugloss, and by apothecaries, Enchusa.IT is called in some countries, Water Hemp, Bastard Hemp, and Bastard Agrimony, Eupatorium, and Hepatorium, because it strengthens the liver.SEVERAL counties give it different names, so that there is scarcely any herb growing of that bigness that has got so many: It is called Cat’s-foot, Ground-ivy, Gill-go-by-ground, and Gill-creep-by-ground, Turn-hoof, Haymaids, and Alehoof.IT is called Alisander, Horse-parsley, and Wild-parsley, and the Black Pot-herb; the seed of it is that which is usually sold in apothecaries’ shops for Macedonian Parsley-seed.TO write a discription of that which is so well known to be growing almost in every garden, I suppose is altogether needless; yet for its virtue it is of admirable use.BESIDES its common name, by which it is best known by the florists of our days, it is called Flower Gentle, Flower Velure Floramor, and Velvet Flower.CALLED also Wind flower, because they say the flowers never open but when the wind blows. Pliny is my author; if it be not so, blame him. The seed also (if it bears any at all) flies away with the wind.CALLED also Orach, and Arage; it is cultivated for domestic uses.CALLED also Vulvaria, from that part of the body upon which the operation is most; also Dog’s Arrach, Goat’s Arrach, and Stinking Motherwort.TO put a gloss upon their practice, the physicians call a herb (which country people vulgarly know by the name of Dead Nettle) Archangel; whether they favour more of superstition or folly, I leave to the judicious reader. There is more curiosity than courtesy to my countrymen used by others in the explanation as well of the names, as discription of this so well known herb; which that I may not also be guilty of, take this short discription: first, of the Red Archangel. This is likewise called Bee Nettle.The hot Arssmart is called also Water-pepper, or Culrage. The mild Arssmart is called dead Arssmart Persicaria, or Peach-wort, because the leaves are so like the leaves of a peach-tree; it is also called Plumbago.This is so well known, that time would be misspent in writing a description of it; therefore I shall only insist upon the virtues of it.THIS herb is so well known to be an inhabitant almost in every garden, that I shall not need to write any discription thereof, although its virtues, which are many, may not be omitted.THE shrub is so well known by every boy or girl that has but attained to the age of seven years, that it needs no description.THE continual usefulness hereof hath made all in general so acquainted herewith that it is altogether needless to describe it, several kinds hereof plentifully growing, being yearly sown in this land. The virtues thereof take as follow.And away to Dr. Reason went I, who told me it was an herb of Mars, and under the Scorpion, and perhaps therefore called Basilicon; and it is no marvel if it carry a kind of virulent quality with it. Being applied to the place bitten by venomous beasts, or stung by a wasp or hornet, it speedily draws the poison to it; _Every like draws his like._ Mizaldus affirms, that, being laid to rot in horse-dung, it will breed venomous beasts. Hilarius, a French physician, affirms upon his own knowledge, that an acquaintance of his, by common smelling to it, had a scorpion bred in his brain. Something is the matter; this herb and rue will not grow together, no, nor near one another: and we know rue is as great an enemy to poison as any that grows.THIS is so well known that it needs no description: I shall therefore only write the virtues thereof, which are many.BOTH the garden and field beans are so well known, that it saves me the labour of writing any description of them. The virtues follow.BESIDES the common name above written, it is called Cheese-Rennet, because it performs the same office, as also Gailion, Pettimugget, and Maiden-hair; and by some Wild Rosemary.OF Beets there are two sorts, which are best known generally, and whereof I shall principally treat at this time, _viz._ the white and red Beets and their virtues.CALLED also Brown-wort, and in Yorkshire, Bishop’s-leaves.IN treating of this tree, you must understand, that I mean the green mast Beech, which is by way of distinction from that other small rough sort, called in Sussex the smaller Beech, but in Essex Horn-beam.THIS small herb grows not above a span high with many branches spread upon the ground, set with many wings of small leaves. The flowers grow upon the branches, many small ones of a pale yellow colour being set a-head together, which afterwards turn into small jointed pods, well resembling the claw of small birds, whence it took its name.BESIDES the common name Bishop’s-weed, it is usually known by the Greek name _Ammi_ and _Ammois_; some call it Æthiopian Cummin-seed, and others Cummin-royal, as also Herb William, and Bull-wort.IT is called Snakeweed, English Serpentary, Dragon-wort, Osterick, and Passions.IT is so well known that it needs no description. The virtues thereof are as follows:—THESE are so well known to the inhabitants in every garden that I hold it needless to describe them.IT is called Syanus, I suppose from the colour of it; Hurt-sickle, because it turns the edge of the sickles that reap the corn; Blue-blow, Corn-flower, and Blue-bottle.BESIDES the common name Brank-Ursine, it is also called Bear’s-breach, and Acanthus, though I think our English names to be more proper; for the Greek word _Acanthus_, signifies any thistle whatsoever.IT is called Wild, and Wood Vine, Tamus, or Ladies’ Seal. The white is called White Vine by some; and the black, Black Vine.IT is called Ruscus, and Bruscus, Kneeholm, Kneeholly, Kneehulver, and Pettigree.TO spend time in writing a description hereof is altogether needless, it being so generally used by all the good housewives almost through this land to sweep their houses with, and therefore very well known to all sorts of people.THE decoction thereof in wine, is thought to be as effectual to void the stone in the kidney or bladder, and to provoke urine, as the Broom itself. The juice thereof is a singular good help to cure as well green wounds, as old and filthy sores and malignant ulcers. The insolate oil, wherein there has been three or four repetitions of infusion of the top stalks, with flowers strained and cleared, cleanses the skin from all manner of spots, marks, and freckles that rise either by the heat of the sun, or the malignity of humours. As for the Broom and Broom-rape, Mars owns them, and is exceeding prejudicial to the liver, I suppose by reason of the antipathy between Jupiter and Mars; therefore if the liver be disaffected, minister none of it.IT is called Hart’s-horn, Herba-stella and Herba-stellaria, Sanguinaria, Herb-Eve, Herb-Ivy, Wort-Tresses, and Swine-Cresses.BESIDES the name Bugle, it is called Middle Confound and Middle Comfrey, Brown Bugle, and by some Sicklewort, and Herb-Carpenter; though in Essex we call another herb by that name.IT is called Sanguisorbia, Pimpinella, Bipulo, Solbegrella, &c. The common garden Burnet is so well known, that it needs no description.—There is another sort which is wild, the description whereof take as follows:—THEY are also called Personata, and Loppy-major, great Burdock and Clod-bur. It is so well known, even by the little boys, who pull off the burs to throw and stick upon each other, that I shall spare to write any description of it.I SHALL spare labour in writing a description of these, since almost every one that can but write at all, may describe them from his own knowledge, they being generally so well known, that descriptions are altogether needless.IT is so well known every where, that it is but lost time and labour to describe it. The virtues thereof are as follow.THEY are called also Tribulus Aquaticus, Tribulus Lacusoris, Tribulus Marinus, Caltrops, Saligos, Water Nuts, and Water Chesnuts.IT is called Carduus Benedictus, or Blessed Thistle, or Holy Thistle. I suppose the name was put upon it by some that had little holiness themselves.GARDEN Carrots are so well known, that they need no description; but because they are of less physical use than the wild kind (as indeed almost in all herbs the wild are the most effectual in physic, as being more powerful in operation than the garden kinds,) I shall therefore briefly describe the Wild Carrot.IT is on account of the seeds principally that the Carraway is cultivated.I WONDER what ailed the ancients to give this the name Celandine, which resembles it neather in nature nor form; it acquired the name of Pilewort from its virtues, and it being no great matter where I set it down, so I set it down at all, I humoured Dr. Tradition so much, as to set him down here.I SUPPOSE there are few but know this tree, for its fruit’s sake; and therefore I shall spare writing a description thereof.IT is called Cerefolium, Mirrhis, and Mirrha, Chervil, Sweet Chervil, and Sweet Cicely.IT were as needless to describe a tree so commonly known as to tell a man he had gotten a mouth; therefore take the government and virtues of them thus:THEY are called Earth-nuts, Earth Chesnuts, Ground Nuts, Ciper-nuts, and in Sussex Pig-nuts. A description of them were needless, for every child knows them.IT is so generally known to most people, that I shall not trouble you with the description thereof, nor myself with setting forth the several kinds, since but only two or three are considerable for their usefulness.CALLED also Rush Leeks, Chives, Civet, and Sweth.WILD Clary is most blasphemously called Christ’s Eye, because it cures diseases of the eye. I could wish for my soul, blasphemy, ignorance, and tyranny, were ceased among physicians, that they may be happy, and I joyful.IT is also called Aperine, Goose-shade, Goose-grass, and Cleavers.THESE are so well known, growing almost in every garden, that I think I may save the expence of time in writing a description of them.CALLED also Coughwort, Foal’s-foot, Horse-hoof, and Bull’s-foot.THIS is a very common but a very neglected plant. It contains very great virtues.IT is also called by some Toothwort, Tooth Violet, Dog-Teeth Violet, and Dentaria.THIS is so frequently known to be an inhabitant in almost every garden, that I suppose it needless to write a description thereof.BESIDES Cudweed and Cottonweed, it is also Called Chaffweed, Dwarf Cotton, and Petty Cotton.BOTH the wild and garden Cowslips are so well known, that I neither trouble myself nor the reader with a description of them.CALLED also Water Sengreen, Knight’s Pond Water, Water House-leek, Pond Weed, and Fresh-water Soldier.THIS herb receives its name from the situation of its leaves.MANY are the names this furious biting herb has obtained, almost enough to make up a Welchman’s pedigree, if he fetch no farther than John of Gaunt, or William the Conquerer; for it is called Frog’s-foot, from the Greek name Barrakion: Crowfoot, Gold Knobs, Gold Cups, King’s Knob, Baffiners, Troilflowers, Polts, Locket Gouions, and Butterflowers.IT is called Aron, Janus, Barba-aron, Calve’s-foot, Ramp, Starchwort, Cuckow-point, and Wake Robin.[VIRTUES] THERE is no dispute to be made, but that they are under the dominion of the Moon, though they are so much cried out against for their coldness, and if they were but one degree colder they would be poison. The best of Galenists hold them to be cold and moist in the second degree, and then not so hot as either lettuce or purslain: They are excellently good for a hot stomach, and hot liver; the unmeasurable use of them fills the body full of raw humours, and so indeed the unmeasurable use of any thing else doth harm. The face being washed with their juice, cleanses the skin, and is excellently good for hot rheums in the eyes; the seed is excellently good to provoke urine, and cleanses the passages thereof when they are stopped: there is not a better remedy for ulcers in the bladder growing, than Cucumbers are; The usual course is, to use the seeds in emulsions, as they make almond milk; but a far better way (in my opinion) is this; When the season of the year is, take the Cucumbers and bruise them well, and distil the water from them, and let such as are troubled with ulcers in the bladder drink no other drink. The face being washed with the same water, cures the reddest face that is; it is also excellently good for sun-burning, freckles, and morphew.THESE are so well known almost to every child, that I suppose it needless to write any description of them. Take therefore the virtues of them as follows.IT is called Jam and Wray: in Sussex they call it Crop, it being a pestilent enemy among corn.MANY kinds of these are so well known, that I shall not trouble you with a description of them: My book grows big too fast.THIS is so well known to swim on the tops of standing waters, as ponds, pools, and ditches, that it is needless further to describe it.THEY are so well known to every one that plants them in their gardens, they need no description; if not, let them look down to the lower end of the stalks, and see how like a snake they look.I HOLD it needless to write any description of this, since every boy that plays with a pop-gun will not mistake another tree instead of Elder: I shall therefore in this place only describe the Dwarf-Elder, called also Dead-wort, and Wall-wort.THIS tree is so well known, growing generally in all counties of this land, that it is needless to describe it.EVERY garden affords this so plentifully, that it needs no description.BESIDES the common name in English, Hog’s Fennel, and the Latin name Peucidanum, is called Hoar-strange, and Hoar-strong, Sulphur-wort, and Brimstone-wort.TO give a description of a tree so well known to every body that keep it in his garden, were needless. They prosper very well in our English gardens, yet are fitter for medicine than for any other profit which is gotten by the fruit of them.IT is so well known, being nourished up in most gardens, that I shall not need to spent time in writing a description thereof.IT is as well known by this name, as it is in some counties by the name of Gorz or Whins, that I shall not need to write any description thereof, my intent being to teach my countrymen what they know not, rather than to tell them again of that which is generally known before.THE offensiveness of the breath of him that hath eaten Garlick, will lead you by the nose to the knowledge hereof, and (instead of a description) direct you to the place where it grows in gardens, which kinds are the best, and most physical.IT is confessed that Gentian, which is most used amongst us, is brought over from beyond sea, yet we have two sorts of it growing frequently in our nation, which, besides the reasons so frequently alledged why English herbs should be fittest for English bodies, has been proved by the experience of divers physicians, to be not a wit inferior in virtue to that which comes from beyond sea, therefore be pleased to take the description of them as follows.IT is vain to describe an herb so well known.OF this I shall briefly describe their kinds, which are principally used in physic, the virtues whereof are alike, though somewhat different in their manner and form of growing.CALLED also Feapberry, and in Sussex Dewberry-Bush, and in some Counties Wineberry.THIS is that herb which such physicians as are licensed to blaspheme by authority, without danger of having their tongues burned through with an hot iron, called an herb of the Trinity. It is also called by those that are more moderate, Three Faces in a Hood, Live in Idleness, Cull me to you; and in Sussex we call them Pancies.THE Latins call them Cinera, only our college calls them Artichocus.HAZEL Nuts are so well known to every body, that they need no description.THERE are several sorts of Hawk-weed, but they are similar in virtues.IT is not my intention to trouble you with a description of this tree, which is so well known that it needs none. It is ordinarily but a hedge bush, although being pruned and dressed, it grows to a tree of a reasonable height.THIS is so well known to every good housewife in the country, that I shall not need to write any description of it.DIVERS sorts there are of this plant; the first of which is an Italian by birth, and only nursed up here in the gardens of the curious. Two or three sorts are found commonly growing wild here, the description of two of which I shall give you.IT is also called Setter-wort, Setter-grass, Bear’s-foot, Christmas-herb, and Christmas-flowers.THE Herb Robert is held in great estimation by farmers, who use it in diseases of their cattle.HYSSOP is so well known to be an inhabitant in every garden, that it will save me labour in writing a description thereof. The virtues are as follow.THESE are so well known that they need no description; I mean the manured kind, which every good husband or housewife is acquainted with.THERE are two kinds of Horehound, the white and the black. The black sort is likewise called Hen-bit; but the white one is here spoken of.OF that there are many kinds, but I shall not trouble you nor myself with any large description of them, which to do, were but, as the proverb is, To find a knot in a rush, all the kinds thereof being nothing else but knotted rushes, some with leaves, and some without. Take the description of the most eminent sort as follows.BOTH these are so well known to my countrymen, that I shall not need to write any description of them.FOR to describe a tree so well known is needless.THIS is a very beautiful shrub, and is a great ornament to our meadows.IT is so well known to every child almost, to grow in woods upon the trees, and upon the stone walls of churches, houses, &c. and sometimes to grow alone of itself, though but seldom.FOR to give a description of a bush so commonly known is needless.IT is generally known so well that it needs no description.BEING an inhabitant almost in every garden, it is so well known, that it needs no description.IT being a common garden herb, I shall forbear the description, only take notice, that it flowers in June and July.THIS is a very pretty ornament to the sides of most meadows.IT is so well known, being generally used as a Sallad-herb, that it is altogether needless to write any description thereof.OF these there are two principally noted kinds, _viz._ the White and the Yellow.CALLED also Conval Lily, Male Lily, and Lily Confancy.IT were in vain to describe a plant so commonly known in every one’s garden; therefore I shall not tell you what they are, but what they are good for.THERE are, according to some botanists, upwards of three hundred different kinds of Liverwort.IT is likewise called Grass-polly.To the former give me leave to add this, and I shall say no more but only describe it to you, and for the virtues refer you to the former, since whatever is said of them, may be also said of this.COMMON Mallows are generally so well known that they need no description.[VIRTUES] IT is under the dominion of Jupiter. The decoction either of the leaves or bark, must needs strengthen the liver much, and so you shall find it to do, if you use it. It is excellently good to open obstructions both of the liver and spleen, and eases pains of the sides thence proceeding.CALLED also Origanum, Eastward Marjoram; Wild Marjoram, and Grove Marjoram.SWEET Marjoram is so well known, being an inhabitant in every garden, that it is needless to write any description thereof, neither of the Winter Sweet Marjoram, or Pot Marjoram.THESE being so plentiful in every garden, and so well known that they need no description.HAVING described unto you that which is called French Mercury, I come now to shew you a description of this kind also.OF all the kinds of Mint, the Spear Mint, or Heart Mint, being most usual, I shall only describe as follows:I SHALL not trouble the reader with a description of these, since my intent is to speak only of two kinds, as the most principal, viz. Ground Moss and Tree Moss, both which are very well known.THIS is so well known where it grows, that it needs no description.NETTLES are so well known, that they need no description; they may be found by feeling, in the darkest night.IT is so well known (the timber thereof being the glory and safety of this nation by sea) that it needs no description.ARE so well known that they need no description.IT has almost as many several names attributed to the several sorts of it, as would almost fill a sheet of paper; as dog-stones, goat-stones, fool-stones, fox-stones, satiricon, cullians, together with many others too tedious to rehearse.THEY are so well known, that I need not spend time about writing a description of them.THIS is so well known, that it needs no description.THE garden kind thereof is so well known (the root being commonly eaten) that I shall not trouble you with any description of it. But the wild kind being of more physical use, I shall in this place describe it unto you.PEAR Trees are so well known, that they need no description.COMMON Pellitory of Spain, if it be planted in our gardens, will prosper very well; yet there is one sort growing ordinarily here wild, which I esteem to be little inferior to the other, if at all. I shall not deny you the description of them both.PENNYROYAL is so well known unto all, I mean the common kind, that it needs no description.IF Superstition had not been the father of Tradition, as well as Ignorance the Mother of Devotion, this herb, (as well as St. John’s Wort) hath found some other name to be known by; but we may say of our forefathers, as St. Paul of the Athenians, _I perceive in many things you are too superstitious_. Yet seeing it is come to pass, that custom having got in possession, pleads prescription for the name, I shall let it pass, and come to the description of the herb, which take as follows.THIS grows usually in meadows and fields, and by path sides, and is so well known, that it needs no description.ARE so well known that they need no description.THERE are two sorts of Poplars, which are most familiar with us, viz. the Black and White, both which I shall here describe unto you.OF this I shall describe three kinds, _viz._ the White and Black of the Garden, and the Erratic Wild Poppy, or Corn Rose.GARDEN Purslain (being used as a sallad herb) is so well known that it needs no description; I shall therefore only speak of its virtues as follows.THEY are so well known, that they need no description. Of the leaves of Primroses is made as fine a salve to heal wounds as any that I know; you shall be taught to make salves of any herb at the latter end of the book: make this as you are taught there, and do not (you that have any ingenuity in you) see your poor neighbours go with wounded limbs when an halfpenny cost will heal them.THE garden Raddish is so well known, that it needs no description.IT is called also St. James’-wort, and Stagger-wort, and Stammer-wort, and Segrum.OF this there are two kinds which I shall speak of, _viz._ the red and yellow.IN regard the Garden Rocket is rather used as a sallad herb than to any physical purposes, I shall omit it, and only speak of the common wild Rocket. The description whereof take as follows.I HOLD it altogether needless to trouble the reader with a description of any of these, since both the garden Roses, and the Roses of the briars are well enough known: take therefore the virtues of them as follows; And first I shall begin with the garden kinds.IT is likewise called Red-rot, and Youth-wort.OUR garden Rosemary is so well known, that I need not describe it.DO not start, and say, This grows you know not how far off: and then ask me, How it comes to pass that I bring it among our English simples? For though the name may speak it foreign, yet it grows with us in England, and that frequent enough in our gardens; and when you have thoroughly pursued its virtues, you will conclude it nothing inferior to that which is brought out of China, and by that time this hath been as much used as that hath been, the name which the other hath gotten will be eclipsed by the fame of this; take therefore a description at large of it as follows:GARDEN-RUE is so well known by this name, and the name Herb of Grace, that I shall not need to write any farther description of it, but shall shew you the virtue of it, as follows.ALTHOUGH there are many kinds of Rushes, yet I shall only here insist upon those which are best known, and most medicinal; as the bulrushes, and other of the soft and smooth kinds, which grow so commonly in almost every part of this land, and are so generally noted, that I suppose it needless to trouble you with any description of them: Briefly then take the virtues of them as follows:THIS is so well known in all the counties of this land, and especially to the country-people, who feed much thereon, that if I did describe it, they would presently say, I might as well have spared that labour. Its virtue follows.THE herb needs no description, it being known generally where it grows.OUR ordinary garden Sage needs no description.THIS herb is by many called Butter-wort.BOTH these are so well known (being entertained as constant inhabitants in our gardens) that they need no description.TO describe a plant so well known is needless, it being nursed up almost in every garden, and abides green all the Winter.IT is so well known in the place where it grows, that it needs no description.IT is called Whoreman’s Permacety, Shepherd’s Scrip, Shepherd’s Pounce, Toy-wort, Pickpurse, and Casewort.THIS is also very well known, and therefore I shall not trouble the reader with any description thereof.OUR ordinary Sorrel, which grows in gardens, and also wild in the fields, is so well known, that it needs no description.SOW Thistles are generally so well known, that they need no description.SOUTHERN Wood is so well known to be an ordinary inhabitant in our gardens, that I shall not need to trouble you with any description thereof.THESE are so well known through this land, that they need no description.IT is so well known in the place where it grows, that it needs no description.GARDEN Tansy is so well known, that it needs no description.THIS is also so well known, that it needs no description.OF these are many kinds growing here in England which are so well known, that they need no description: Their difference is easily known on the places where they grow, _viz._IT is so well known, that it needs no description, being used with the clothworkers.IT is so well known, that it needs no description.IT is in vain to describe an herb so commonly known.WILD Thyme also is so well known, that it needs no description.IT is so well known, especially by the name of Honeysuckles, white and red, that I need not describe them.BESIDES the ordinary sort of Trefoil, here are two more remarkable, and one of which may be properly called Heart Trefoil, not only because the leaf is triangular, like the heart of a man, but also because each leaf contains the perfection of a heart, and that in its proper colour, viz. a flesh colour.IT differs not from the common sort, save only in this particular, it hath a white spot in the leaf like a pearl. It is particularly under the dominion of the Moon, and its icon shews that it is of a singular virtue against the pearl, or pin and web in the eyes.THE leaves of the English vine (I do not mean to send you to the Canaries for a medicine) being boiled, makes a good lotion for sore mouths; being boiled with barley meal into a poultice, it cools inflammations of wounds; the dropping of the vine, when it is cut in the Spring, which country people call Tears, being boiled in a syrup, with sugar, and taken inwardly, is excellent to stay women’s longings after every thing they see, which is a disease many women with child are subject to. The decoction of Vine leaves in white wine doth the like. Also the tears of the Vine, drank two or three spoonfuls at a time, breaks the stone in the bladder. This is a very good remedy, and it is discreetly done, to kill a Vine to cure a man, but the salt of the leaves are held to be better. The ashes of the burnt branches will make teeth that are as black as a coal, to be as white as snow, if you but every morning rub them with it. It is a most gallant Tree of the Sun, very sympathetical with the body of men, and that is the reason spirit of wine is the greatest cordial among all vegetables.BOTH the tame and the wild are so well known, that they need no description.THE garden kind are so well known that they need no description.IT is so well known, that it needs no description.THE common kind grows bushing with many leaves, long, narrow and flat upon the ground; of a dark blueish green colour, somewhat like unto Woad, but nothing so large, a little crumpled, and as it were round-pointed, which do so abide the first year; and the next spring from among them, rise up divers round stalks, two or three feet high, beset with many such like leaves thereon, but smaller, and shooting forth small branches, which with the stalks carry many small yellow flowers, in a long spiked head at the top of them, where afterwards come the seed, which is small and black, inclosed in heads that are divided at the tops into four parts. The root is long, white and thick, abiding the Winter. The whole herb changes to be yellow, after it hath been in flower awhile.ALL the several kinds thereof are so well known unto almost all people, that it is all together needless to write a description thereof.THESE are so well known that they need no description. I shall therefore only shew you the virtues therof.IT is a plant so common, that every one that hath eyes knows it, and he that hath none, cannot read a description, if I should write it.THREE Wormwoods are familiar with us; one I shall not describe, another I shall describe, and the third be critical at; and I care not greatly if I begin with the last first.The other day Mars told me he met with Venus, and he asked her, What was the reason that she accused him for abusing women? He never gave them the pox. In the dispute they fell out, and in anger parted, and Mars told me that his brother Saturn told him, that an antivenerean medicine was the best against the pox. Once a month he meets with the Moon. Mars is quick enough of speech, and the Moon not much behind hand, (neither are most women.) The Moon looks much after children, and children are much troubled with the worms; she desired a medicine of him, he bid her take his own herb, Wormwood. He had no sooner parted with the Moon, but he met with Venus, and she was as drunk as a hog; Alas! poor Venus, quoth he; What! thou a fortune, and be drunk? I’ll give thee antipathetical cure; Take my herb Wormwood, and thou shall never get a surfeit by drinking. A poor silly countryman hath got an ague, and cannot go about his business: he wishes he had it not, and so do I; but I will tell him a remedy, whereby he shall prevent it; Take the herb of Mars, Wormwood, and if infortunes will do good, what will fortunes do? Some think the lungs are under Jupiter; and if the lungs then the breath; and though sometimes a man gets a stinking breath, and yet Jupiter is a fortune, forsooth; up comes Mars to him; Come brother Jupiter, thou knowest I sent thee a couple of trines to thy house last night, the one from Aries, and the other from Scorpio; give me thy leave by sympathy to cure this poor man with drinking a draught of Wormwood beer every morning. The Moon was weak the other day, and she gave a man two terrible mischiefs, a dull brain and a weak sight; Mars laid by his sword, and comes to her; Sister Moon, said he, this man hath angered thee, but I beseech thee take notice he is but a fool; prithee be patient, I will with my herb wormwood cure him of both infirmities by antipathy, for thou knowest thou and I cannot agree; with that the Moon began to quarrel; Mars (not delighting much in women’s tongues) went away, and did it whether she would or no.
